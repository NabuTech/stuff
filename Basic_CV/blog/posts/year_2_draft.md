# My Journey in Software Development: Year Two - The Climb

## Epigraph

"There’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for."
— J.R.R. Tolkien, The Two Towers

## Introduction

As my journey continued, the road became steeper, and the challenges ahead multiplied. Year two felt like Frodo's ascent- a long, grueling climb with shadows colosing in. The second year of the diploma tested my resolve, introducing more complex concepts and projects that pushed my limits.

## The Expanding Horizon

The landscape shifted dramatically in year two. It began with Data Structures and Algorithms, exploring C# and software design patterns. Transitioning from Python to C# was immensely callenging, with C#s stricter syntax rules, complex variable types, and heavy object-oriented focus- requiring me to define classes and use IDEs like Visual Studio, which felt overwhelming compared to the simplicity of VS Code or Pycharm.

To complicate matter, I was also diving into Mobile App Development using Xamarin for cross-platform development.

Next came Game Development using Godot and Software Testing and Maintenance using Python and Git. Unfortunately, due to COVID U I became ill and made the difficult but sensible decision to repeat the term rather than struggle through it.
Unfortunately the school dropped Game Development and introduced Advanced Mobile Development. Knowing what to expect this time with Software Testing and Maintenance allowed me to sharpen my git skills and really get a grasp of command line in both Windows and Linux. 
Advanced Mobile Development just to compound matters had switched from Xamarin to React Native, this left me at a distinct disadvantage as I now had to learn React at the same time and come to terms with JavaScript with barely having any experience. Like C# before React and JavaScript was like reading elvish- alien and incomprehensible, and I really struggled to grasp the concepts. 


## Respite

At this point the focus shifted to teamwork and software development methodologies. Classes in Agile Project Management and Secure Web App Development dealt with Agile Methodologies, Kanban, Scrum and Devops, and applying those principles using Django in Web App Development. The teamwork and project management came very easy to me due to my previous management work experience and helped rebuild my confidence. However, due to the nature of the group work, and it being easy for the team to rely on my project management experience this became my focus and I feel like I missed opportunities to develop my coding skills and learning Django adequately.

The year concluded with Data Access Management, delving deeper into databases including non-SQL with MongoDB something to come in handy later. More Agile application using project management with Django, where once again my skillset and knowledge prevented me from growing or learning. Web services covered a wide range of topics from software architecture to SOAP, RESTful Web Services, APIS, Webhooks and tools like Zapier. 

## Challenges

This was an immensley challenging year, the ever-changing landscape of topics, languages and frameworks felt impossible to absorb everything in such a short period, every re-visit felt like starting from scratch. My confidence took a big hit and I felt completly overwhelmed, incapable and that I was not progressing at all. It was a year of self-doubt, where the struggle to keep up overshadowed the joy of learning.

## Top of the Mountain

The year culminated in the final project, a full-stack application of our choice with a partner. Having someone to work with who was facing similar struggles was a godsend. We chose the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) based on industry trends at the time. Taking the front-end role was a deliberate choice—I wanted to conquer my demons with React and JavaScript. Though our project was likely too complex for the timeframe, we learned a lot along the way. With strong project management and mutual support, we managed to deliver something we were proud of and the experience was invaluable.

## Conclusion

Year two was a turning point, where the seemingly insurmountable hurdles knocked me down time and again, but I eventually conquered them. Completing the final project restored my confidence. The nuggets of information I thought I hadn’t absorbed began to surface, revealing deeper understanding. More importantly, I overcame the fear of failure. The hesitation to build or try new things due to lack of knowledge or potential mistakes is now behind me. While my early attempts were imperfect (or outright disasters), I learned that practice and persistence are key to improvement. Self-reflection became a powerful tool in my growth as a developer, and a valuable lesson in life.
